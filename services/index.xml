Whether that be Speech-to-Text (STT) to understand what a user says, whether that be Text-to-speech (TTS) for a computer to speak to a user, Natural Language Understanding to infer what someone meant by a certain phrase. Or using a Machine Learning algorithm to infer a future result from a dataset. Or Computer Vision to have a machine do the heavy lifting processing images or videos.</description></item><item><title>Desktop</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/desktop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 14:59:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/desktop/</guid><description>While an “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” mentality might seem out of date, there’s a lot of truth behind it. People get far too confusing nowadays using technology that isn’t up to par, just because it’s “new” and shiny.
We use Javascript. It’s top-notch, and we’re really good at it.
How do we make your desktop apps look so ace? We use Electron. If you’ve never heard of it before, chances are you’ve heard of things like WhatsApp or Twitch - both of which were created using Electron.</description></item><item><title>Consulting</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/consulting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:35:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/consulting/</guid><description>We’ve been in the technology industry for 15+ years - even though we don’t look a day over 14. In those years, we’ve been lucky enough to build up our own personal technological libraries in our minds. As a result, we have also been able to do everything from educating clients on things like best practices to sharing with them where they should be aiming to reach their goals.
Our custom software consultancy services can also help clients to dig into any existing problems with their technology stack.</description></item><item><title>Ui Ux</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/ui-ux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:17:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/ui-ux/</guid><description>Functional technology is easy. That’s especially true in today’s world where it can often feel like developers are a dime a dozen. Admittedly, we started out that way, too. When we were met with a task, we got the job done, and there was nothing wrong with any of those projects.
But, it wasn’t sustainable, and looking back, it wasn’t usable or attractive. Over our years of experience and advancements in technology, we have learned that it doesn’t necessarily matter how functional something is if it’s not easy to use and enjoyable.</description></item><item><title>Mobile</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/mobile/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:15:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/mobile/</guid><description>It’s impossible to ignore the impact mobile has had on the way people search the web, use apps, etc. In fact, it’s the way a large majority of the population gets anything done, and there’s no sign of that trend slowing down any time soon.
So, we’ve been involved in the mobile world for 5-6 years. Initially, we used our sweet web skills to create Cordova/PhoneGap apps. The problem? That didn’t always make for a great user experience, so we backed off.</description></item><item><title>Web</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/web/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:15:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/web/</guid><description>At Make IT Simple, web applications make us giddy. They’re our bread and butter. They are truly what we do best and what we started with.
It’s easy for some people to get confused trying to understand the difference between a web application and a website. Web applications are things like Facebook, or where you do your online banking. Of course, those might look like websites when you’re checking them in your browser, but they are actually applications that take a lot longer to build - we’re talking thousands of hours.</description></item><item><title>Voicebot</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/voicebot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/voicebot/</guid><description>When you hear the word “voicebot,” it probably sounds like some kind of futuristic robot from a sci-fi movie. Well, the future is here. While we’re not living in a sci-fi flick, voicebots, or “conversational AI” have become increasingly popular in recent years due to the way they can gather information and make people feel more comfortable.
Because people are inundated with ads and marketing schemes on a daily basis, conversational AI gives them a way to feel more connected.</description></item></channel></rss>
