We love creating. Every last one of us would be doing this even if we had to do something else for work. Building technology from scratch for a wide range of clients is hard. We are all totally committed to every single project. Often to the detriment of our families and social lives.

Each team would argue they are the most important and nothing would get done without them. Clearly it takes two to tango. Nothing gets done without both working in beautiful harmony.</p><p>&ldquo;Dev&rdquo; is fairly self explanatory. They are software developers, software engineers, programmers, coders, whatever. This is by far the larger of the teams here at Make IT Simple.</p><p>&ldquo;Non dev&rdquo; is a bit more wide ranging. They are those that do the work ahead of, during and after development to make it go smoothly. Speaking to clients, writing specifications, doing estimates, project planning, managing schedules, testing the work and hand holding the client.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://example.org/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2020</a><div></div></div></footer><script src=/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
