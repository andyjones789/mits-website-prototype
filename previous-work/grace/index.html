Right from the outset, their approach was to change the way law was done. They work on behalf of insurance companies to offer pro-active support to their clients who have taken out a business risk policy. The idea being prevention is always better than a cure. As well as world class telephone and email support for their valued clients, RRadar wanted to add to their already successful &ldquo;station&rdquo; tool, which is a powerful knowledge base. &ldquo;Station&rdquo; was the go-to for customers looking to answer legal questions if they didn&rsquo;t want to talk to someone.</p><p>Given the rise in popularity in chatbots and voice search, RRadar were regularly told by their clients an Alexa or Siri style tool would help them day-to-day.</p><p>Enter Grace&mldr;</p><p>Make IT Simple were commissioned to build Grace, a smart legal assistant. She would need to understand a human talking to her, what question they were asking, find the answer and speak back.</p><p>Tech jargon: Speech-to-Text (STT) is used to understand what the human has said and converts it to text. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is used to understand the &ldquo;intent&rdquo; behind what someone asked. ie &ldquo;Siri make me some toast&rdquo; - &ldquo;MakeToast&rdquo; would be the intent. A Decision Tree is used to understand what this intent might mean given where the user is in the conversation to get the answer to their question. Text-to-Speech (TTS) is then used convert the text answer into audio speech that plays to the user.
And this all had to happen within 1 second.</p><p>Grace was built as a Meteor App that was optimised for Web, iOS and Android.</p><p>TODO Add images: <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B-GKE2WJp2rMc0lUcHQzN0VTX00>https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B-GKE2WJp2rMc0lUcHQzN0VTX00</a></p><p>TODO TreeBu?</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class=mt6></div></section><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2020</a><div><a href=https://twitter.com/makeitsimpleuk target=_blank class="link-transition twitter link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Twitter link" rel=noopener aria-label="follow on Twitter——Opens in a new window"><svg height="32" style="enable-background:new 0 0 67 67" viewBox="0 0 67 67" width="32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M37.167 22.283c-2.619.953-4.274 3.411-4.086 6.101l.063 1.038-1.048-.127c-3.813-.487-7.145-2.139-9.974-4.915l-1.383-1.377-.356 1.017c-.754 2.267-.272 4.661 1.299 6.271.838.89.649 1.017-.796.487-.503-.169-.943-.296-.985-.233-.146.149.356 2.076.754 2.839.545 1.06 1.655 2.097 2.871 2.712l1.027.487-1.215.021c-1.173.0-1.215.021-1.089.467.419 1.377 2.074 2.839 3.918 3.475l1.299.444-1.131.678c-1.676.976-3.646 1.526-5.616 1.568C19.775 43.256 19 43.341 19 43.405c0 .211 2.557 1.397 4.044 1.864 4.463 1.377 9.765.783 13.746-1.568 2.829-1.673 5.657-5 6.978-8.221.713-1.716 1.425-4.851 1.425-6.354.0-.975.063-1.102 1.236-2.267.692-.678 1.341-1.419 1.467-1.631.21-.403.188-.403-.88-.043-1.781.636-2.033.551-1.152-.402.649-.678 1.425-1.907 1.425-2.267.0-.063-.314.042-.671.233-.377.212-1.215.53-1.844.72l-1.131.361-1.027-.7c-.566-.381-1.361-.805-1.781-.932C39.766 21.902 38.131 21.944 37.167 22.283zM33 64C16.432 64 3 50.569 3 34S16.432 4 33 4s30 13.431 30 30S49.568 64 33 64z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:"/></svg><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" width="8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:"/></svg></span></a></div></div></footer><script src=/mits-website-prototype/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
