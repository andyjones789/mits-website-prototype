Building a digital product from scratch is hard work. Really hard work. And it's expensive and time consuming. 

When we speak to a client about a problem they have that they believe needs solving with a digital product, we will always go through this process:

1. Can something off-the-shelf solve it?
2. Can something off-the-shelf be customised to solve it?
3. Can we build an add-on or integrate two off-the-shelf systems to solve it?
4. Ok, custom may be the solution.

There are a bunch of reasons not to go custom:

1. It's expensive
2. It takes ages
3. It's hard. You have to think about everything (or have us do a lot of the thinking for you: TODO link to "how we solve problems")
4. You have to test EVERYTHING (well, we do but you also need to check it TODO link to "what is qa and why")
5. You have to deal with any legal issues - trademarks, copyright etc
6. You have to host and maintain it - we do this for you but you still have to pay for it

So why would anyone "go custom"?

1. If nothing else does what you want then you have no choice
2. You don't build value and "intellectual property" in a business by using something off-the-shelf
3. It's tricky and often not cost effective to re-sell off-the-shelf software. If you build it from scratch, the margins are usually much higher
