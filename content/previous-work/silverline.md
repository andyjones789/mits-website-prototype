Background
---

Silverline (or InRecruit as it was first known) was our first foray into the SaaS (Software as a Service) world. In classic software company fashion, we had a client ask for something and we saw value in building it as a product. The client was a global Recruitment company that had a number of different CRM (Customer Relationship Management)/ATS (Applicant Tracking System) systems in different parts of the world. 

The Challenge
---

Given the disparity of data, they had no way of reporting across all of them and driving sales competition. It was clear that some kind of Data Warehouse was needed (even before the days this was commonplace in larger organisations) and some configurable way of displaying the data for different types of users.

Developing the Solution
---

We started working on a conjoined data model that would accept data in from a varity of sources and allow it to be visualised in different forms. We then built an open API standard that would be the endpoint for data from the individual systems. The initial data types were:

CRM/ATS
HR Systems 
Telephone Call Records and Recordings
Building Entry/Exit

When we had the data in one place, in a standard format, it was then on to building a variety of screens for both a single user to view their performance and their team leaders to view an individual and their teams. We also built a number of office display screens that would show an overview of the best salespeople and allow competitions and leaderboards.
