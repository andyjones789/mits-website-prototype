Background
---

Sports coaching and children’s activities are big business, but most coaches loathe doing admin and chasing payments. It takes hours each week to administer courses and manage fees, yet coaching academies lose substantial income to missed payments, or risk driving away
customers when they ask for
larger block payments.

The Challenge
---

From 25 years running coaching academies, Stuart Twigg
was well aware of the problems of running an efficient,
profitable coaching business. He had investigated options,
but never found a good solution:

All the elements were
available separately,
including bookings,
data collection and
online payment. But
working in isolation

they created even more
admin work than a paper
and cash-based system.
Where products had
been created for the
leisure industry, they

were overflowing with
complicated functionality
that made them hard
for coaches and their
customers to use.

The Solution
---

Stuart discussed his experiences with other coaches and decided
there was a significant need for a new, better approach. He raised
funding and started devising a custom solution.
His vision was a system that allowed participants to make
bookings, provide personal data, setup payments and receive
feedback on sessions from their coach. It would include a mobile
app that was quick and easy for coaches to use on the field or in a
sports hall. And it all needed to be tied together with a web-based
system that minimised admin time for managers.

Finding a Technical Partner
---

Stuart and his financial backers
started by looking at offshore
developers. They spent
hours reviewing profiles and
shortlisting, but after about 20
Skype interviews they realised
that they were looking for
something that wasn’t on offer.
Firstly, Stuart did not have the
technical skills or experience
to create a product specification.
All the offshore developers
wanted a detailed specification
to work from, whereas he
needed someone who could
apply experience and common
sense to help define exactly
what was needed.
Secondly, he recognised that
communication was going to
be essential. He realised that
they would need a really strong
working relationship, built on
collaborative working and
face-to-face meetings.
Once they realised that offshoring

was not going to provide a low-
cost panacea, they approached

Make IT Simple, who Stuart’s
business partner knew from
another project and trusted
to get the job done.

Developing the Solution
---

The team decided on an agile approach,
working together iteratively to map
out how different users would interact
with the system, sketching out mobile
screens and devising the information
architecture that would underpin it all.
One of the greatest challenges was
creating functionality to give parents and
multiple family members the right level
of access, to identify age-appropriate
courses, to make bookings and authorise
payments, and to review feedback and
progress reports from their coach.

As the details of the solution took shape,
they created detailed system designs
and produced a series of prototypes to
get feedback and validate their ideas
with the client.
This iterative development process
was completed for the mobile apps
and web-based admin system and the
software was passed to the testing team.
In particular, they wanted to ensure
a consistently good user experience
across the wide range of Android
devices, iPhones and iPads.


Results
---

The service was launched in Autumn
2017 to a group of early adopters,
including several major rugby and
football academies, as well as hockey
and tennis coaching organisations.

5 Stars
OUTSTANDING

80% OF USERS ARE HIGHLY
SATISFIED and are achieving
enormous reductions in the
time spend on administration.

Andy and the team at Make
IT Simple were great partners
on this project. They listened
to us when we needed to
make changes but equally,
they stood strong when they
knew we were asking for
something that wouldn’t have
worked. No project is plain
sailing all the way through
but they handled everything
well and made sure the
project kept moving forward
at a good pace.

If you are considering a software development project and would like to discuss our approach and track-record, please call 01905 700050 or visit www.makeitsimple.co.uk.
