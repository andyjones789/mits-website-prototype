Originem are our ideal type of client - they knew their market and the solution needed, they had "made do" with off-the-shelf software to prove the market and wanted to build a best in class Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering. The software was to be able to run an Umbrella business - a business that pays temporary workers on behalf of the Recruitment agency that found them work. 

Originem operated an Umbrella on behalf of their clients through their "Cubed" offering. On of the key metrics we were challenges with was the time it took to run a payroll. Their incumbent took around 8hrs to run payroll for 600 workers. Our target was sub 10 minutes. 

We opted for our chosen stack of Node.JS, Angular and MongoDB and the results were impressive. We were able to run a payroll for 16,000 workers in under 3 minutes.

The Originem software has since re-branded as Recruit Payroll and years on it is still the most efficient Umbrella payroll tool money can buy. The owners continue to thrive based mostly on the technology they invested in.
