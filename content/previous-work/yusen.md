Yusen Logistics, although not a well known brand outside of their market, are one of the largest logistics firms in the world. They are vital to the supply chains of a host of brands you would use every day. 

Most of the Logistics world are focussed on legact technology like IBM iSeries. They had a growing number of requirements to interface with a  supplier's and client's systems in more modern ways that were inefficient using the technology they were experienced in. 

We were honoured to be asked to work on a host of projects for well known brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, Samsung, Pure DAB and Weber. 

Wrapping up the requirements for a number of their projects and clients, we built a tool called "Data Flow", which moved data to and from a number of sources and destinations such as SQL Servers, iSeries DB2 files, XML files and API's. In the Just-in-time production world downtime isn't an option so focus was always on 100% uptime. We used intelligent data validation and smart retry's to ensure data got where it needed to safely and efficiently.
