We started the business, we were building technology for users that was perfectly functional. We did the job and it worked at scale but I would not say it was usable, and it was certainly not attractive. The thing we learnt over a number of years is no matter how functional something is, if it's not obvious to the user how to use it or it's not a joy to use, they are not going to get the most out of using it. 

So a few years ago we started employing UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) as a stage in our development and the results have been astronomic. The level of support our clients need for their users to use their systems has dramatically dropped, the joy people have using the technology we build for them is huge. 

The process we go through here is about starting off as cheaply and quickly as possible, usually pen and paper and sketching out where some of the use of flows may go. What some of the elements on the screen may be and where information lives (Information architecture). At every point we are adding clarity and fidelity and stepping our way through answering more questions about user's experience. We then move to low fidelity mockups digital designs in a tool like Sketch. Where you can start to see the shape of the user interface and how the user is going to interact with it. Again we are looking for user research and user feedback. 

At that point and sense checking well it's cheap (cheaper) to do so and then the final stage is full fidelity mockups designs, which show what exactly the system is going to look like and then we are going to build.
