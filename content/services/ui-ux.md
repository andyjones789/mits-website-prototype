Functional technology is easy. That’s especially true in today’s world where it can often feel like developers are a dime a dozen. Admittedly, we started out that way, too. When we were met with a task, we got the job done, and there was nothing wrong with any of those projects.

But, it wasn’t sustainable, and looking back, it wasn’t usable or attractive. Over our years of experience and advancements in technology, we have learned that it doesn’t necessarily matter how functional something is if it’s not easy to use and enjoyable.

## The Importance of User Experience

In recent years, there has been a shift in the development world. Because there are so many websites, apps, and programs, people expect a certain standard when it comes to their experience. A product needs to be easy to understand, or a joy to use. If it isn’t, no one is going to get the most out of using it.

That’s why we started making UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) an important stage in our development process. As a result? Our clients have needed less support for their users because their systems are easier to understand. People enjoy using them and come back for more. Who doesn’t want that?

## What is Our Process?

Our UI/UX process starts off fairly simply. That seems fitting since we want to make sure your users can navigate your product easily.

As we go through the process, we’ll talk about some of the elements on the screen, as well as information architecture. All the while, we’ll add more clarity and get more answers as to what you want your user’s experience to be. From initial mockups where you can start to see the shape of the user interface, to full-fidelity mockup designs, you’ll have your eye on our process every step of the way. UI/UX for custom software is extremely important, but it still isn’t a “cookie-cutter” process. It’s about what fits your needs and what you think your users really want. We can help you to create something they will love.
