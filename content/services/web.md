This is our bread and butter. We've been building for the web for years and years. We know it inside out. We build "web applications". Think Facebook or where you do your online banking. It's fundamentally different to building websites. Similar technology but usually involves 1000's of hours, rather than 10's or 100's. 

## Why Web?

You may have picked up on the "application" part of "web application". You may wonder how that relates to the sort of application you have on your computer like Word or Excel. Well, the are very similar, and it certainly conveys the scope of the undertaking when building one. They are just like desktop applications, they just so happen to run in a Web Browser instead. The reason it's so popular over desktop these days is primarily because it's a (relatively) consistent user experience and rolling out updates is fairly instant. 

Add to that, those little devices we have in our pockets and are glued to also happen to have Web Browsers on them. So build once and you get an audience on desktop and mobile. 

The advancement of client side frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue have made the whole process quicker, easier and more structured.
