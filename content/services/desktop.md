While an “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” mentality might seem out of date, there’s a lot of truth behind it. People get far too confusing nowadays using technology that isn’t up to par, just because it’s “new” and shiny.

We use Javascript. It’s top-notch, and we’re really good at it.

How do we make your desktop apps look so ace? We use Electron. If you’ve never heard of it before, chances are you’ve heard of things like WhatsApp or Twitch - both of which were created using Electron. Again, we’re really good at it, so building you an excellent desktop app is something we’ll enjoy every second of doing.

## Building Rich Desktop Apps

Using Electron allows us to build rich desktop apps with the same rapid stack we build everything in. The apps we create are all cross-platform. So, they will look great on Linux, Windows, or Mac.

What can you expect from your desktop app? Everything from automatic updates to crash reporting, debugging, and profiling. Simply put, it’ll look great and run smoothly all the time. You don’t have to be a programming tech whiz in order to make sure your desktop app is the best - that’s our job.

  
If you’re looking for an easy-to-use app that makes your user experience better whenever you use it, look no further. The beauty of desktop apps is that they can be customised to fit your needs. Since they aren’t web-based, it’s all about what works for you, your business, and your brand. Thankfully, our team of developers knows exactly how to create shiny desktop apps that will make you _feel_ like a tech champ.
