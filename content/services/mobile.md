It’s impossible to ignore the impact mobile has had on the way people search the web, use apps, etc. In fact, it’s the way a large majority of the population gets anything done, and there’s no sign of that trend slowing down any time soon.

So, we’ve been involved in the mobile world for 5-6 years. Initially, we used our sweet web skills to create Cordova/PhoneGap apps. The problem? That didn’t always make for a great user experience, so we backed off.

Because who doesn’t want a slick user experience whether they’re pulling up an app on iOS or Android? If an app doesn’t work properly and isn’t easy to use (or doesn’t look good), it’s going to get ignored on someone’s smart device.

## A Solution to User Experience on Any Platform

Thankfully, Flutter entered the picture, allowing us to build cross-platform apps with a native-level user experience that people love.

Not to pat ourselves on the back (okay, maybe a little), but one of the reasons our app development works so well is due to the fact that we’re a web development company. Apps that store or share data between users need backend information. That’s where we shine. Development. Cloud hosting. It’s what we’ve been doing for years, so we’re happy to be back in the mobile game, bringing our web development skills to good use for something that can fit in the palm of anyone’s hand.
