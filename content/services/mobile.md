We've been playing in the mobile world for 5-6 years. Initially leverage our web skills to build Cordova/PhoneGap apps. Seeing the worse user experience compared to native, we backed off for a year or so. The thing that's always been at our ethos is our clients don't want to build separate iOS and Android apps. They do want the slick user experience that native gives them.

Enter Flutter... 

Truly cross platform but native level user experience. 

Why I believe we are good at app development is because we are primarily a web development company. Any app that stores or shares data between it's users needs some backend. This is web development and cloud hosting. This is our bread and butter.
