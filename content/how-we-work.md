Most business owners choose to start up a company because they have a specific passion or area of knowledge. More often than not, that area of knowledge doesn’t include things like how to design and build a successful digital product, including web/mobile apps.

That’s where we step in as a fully customised, bespoke software company.

## How We Work

When a client approaches us with what they want, it’s rare for us to just build and create it. Instead, we dig deeper into what they’re trying to achieve, and bring forward some of our own creative ideas that they hadn’t thought of. for (within their timeframe and budget) using technology. Our motto around here is; we have two ears and one mouth for a good reason. We take listening to our clients very seriously, but we also consider it our job to advise what could be done in order to make their project and their business even bigger and better.

Mutual success is key, and we strive to help all of our clients be more efficient in their efforts.

## Our Process

We have been in business for 15 years, but our combined experience goes well beyond that. So, tend to know which things work best for specific businesses. Our company focuses on a hybrid approach of both agile and waterfall methods, using a Gannt chart to determine the length of each project and which milestones we’re looking to achieve.

Our process includes starting with a basic outline and working in two-week sprints. We have found that this is the best way for us to get things done effectively while making sure the client knows what they’re getting.
