Off-the-shelf -> Customised -> Bespoke

Working with us
___
It's rare we take exactly what a client wants and build it. 
There's a reason for that - they know their business, but they don't know what technology can achieve. Especially in the timescales and budget they are looking at.
We've even turned a client's business model on it's head and opened up huge opportunity for them. We use the motto - we have two ears and one mouth for a good reason. Listen, think, advise. We'll push hard if we think there is a better way to do something. We're all part of a team where mutual success is key.


Our Process
___

Having done this for 15 years we have some idea on what works and what doesnâ€™t. 

Our approach currently is a hybrid of both agile and traditional waterfall. We see benefits in both and we get the best out of both, so we take the larger view at the start of the waterfall approach, using a Gannt chart, so we have some concept of how long the project is going to take and what are the key milestones. Rather than expecting a client to know every part of the process at the outset, we start with the basic outline and then work on usually two weeks sprints, where we are scoping as we go. This has produced the best result so far and we continue to do it.
