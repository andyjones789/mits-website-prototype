We've been working with various flavours of AI for a number of years now. Whether that be Speech-to-Text (STT) to understand what a user says, whether that be Text-to-speech (TTS) for a computer to speak to a user, Natural Language Understanding to infer what someone meant by a certain phrase. Or using a Machine Learning algorithm to infer a future result from a dataset. Or Computer Vision to have a machine do the heavy lifting processing images or videos.
