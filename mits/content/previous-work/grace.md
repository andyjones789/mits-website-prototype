RRadar are a fascinating client - especially given they are a Law firm! Right from the outset, their approach was to change the way law was done. They work on behalf of insurance companies to offer pro-active support to their clients who have taken out a business risk policy. The idea being prevention is always better than a cure. As well as world class telephone and email support for their valued clients, RRadar wanted to add to their already successful "station" tool, which is a powerful knowledge base. "Station" was the go-to for customers looking to answer legal questions if they didn't want to talk to someone.

Given the rise in popularity in chatbots and voice search, RRadar were regularly told by their clients an Alexa or Siri style tool would help them day-to-day. 

Enter Grace... 

Make IT Simple were commissioned to build Grace, a smart legal assistant. She would need to understand a human talking to her, what question they were asking, find the answer and speak back.

Tech jargon: Speech-to-Text (STT) is used to understand what the human has said and converts it to text. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is used to understand the "intent" behind what someone asked. ie "Siri make me some toast" - "MakeToast" would be the intent. A Decision Tree is used to understand what this intent might mean given where the user is in the conversation to get the answer to their question. Text-to-Speech (TTS) is then used convert the text answer into audio speech that plays to the user.
And this all had to happen within 1 second.

Grace was built as a Meteor App that was optimised for Web, iOS and Android.
