Really hard work. And it&amp;rsquo;s expensive and time consuming.
When we speak to a client about a problem they have that they believe needs solving with a digital product, we will always go through this process:
Can something off-the-shelf solve it? Can something off-the-shelf be customised to solve it? Can we build an add-on or integrate two off-the-shelf systems to solve it?</description></item><item><title>Recruitment</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/industries/recruitment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 11:17:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/industries/recruitment/</guid><description>Make IT Simple&amp;rsquo;s owner Andy Jones started his career in Recruitment and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to shake it ever since.
Over the past 15 years, most of our work has been in the recruitment space, whether that be front, middle or back office.
We&amp;rsquo;ve built and customised a number of CRM&amp;rsquo;s/ATS&amp;rsquo;s as weel as middle office processes, timesheet and back office invoicing, reconciliation and ledger integration.
We&amp;rsquo;ve also built from the ground up a number of systems for master and neutral vendor.</description></item><item><title>Ai</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/ai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:23:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/ai/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working with various flavours of AI for a number of years now. Whether that be
Speech-to-Text (STT) to understand what a user says, whether that be
Text-to-speech (TTS) for a computer to speak to a user,
Natural Language Understanding to infer what someone meant by a certain phrase. Or using a
Machine Learning algorithm to infer a future result from a dataset. Or
Computer Vision to have a machine do the heavy lifting processing images or videos.</description></item><item><title>How We Work</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/how-we-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 16:11:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/how-we-work/</guid><description>Off-the-shelf -&amp;gt; Customised -&amp;gt; Bespoke
Working with us
It&amp;rsquo;s rare we take exactly what a client wants and build it. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason for that - they know their business, but they don&amp;rsquo;t know what technology can achieve. Especially in the timescales and budget they are looking at. We&amp;rsquo;ve even turned a client&amp;rsquo;s business model on it&amp;rsquo;s head and opened up huge opportunity for them. We use the motto - we have two ears and one mouth for a good reason.</description></item><item><title>Silverline</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/silverline/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:53:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/silverline/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Optia</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/optia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:51:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/optia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mongo</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/skills/mongo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:35:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/skills/mongo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:05:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/contact/</guid><description>Here is the form</description></item><item><title>Howtobuildsaas</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/qanda/howtobuildsaas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:18:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/qanda/howtobuildsaas/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Electron</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/skills/electron/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 14:59:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/skills/electron/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Desktop</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/desktop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 14:59:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/desktop/</guid><description>Why work with a different technology?

Whether that be big picture where the client should be aiming or digging in deep into a problem with their technology stack. We can offer consultancy to augment their internal skillset.

We did the job and it worked at scale but I would not say it was usable, and it was certainly not attractive. The thing we learnt over a number of years is no matter how functional something is, if it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious to the user how to use it or it&amp;rsquo;s not a joy to use, they are not going to get the most out of using it.</description></item><item><title>Mobile</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/mobile/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:15:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/mobile/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing in the mobile world for 5-6 years. Initially leverage our web skills to build Cordova/PhoneGap apps. Seeing the worse user experience compared to native, we backed off for a year or so. The thing that&amp;rsquo;s always been at our ethos is our clients don&amp;rsquo;t want to build separate iOS and Android apps. They do want the slick user experience that native gives them.
Enter Flutter&amp;hellip;
Truly cross platform but native level user experience.</description></item><item><title>Web</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/web/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:15:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/services/web/</guid><description>This is our bread and butter. We&amp;rsquo;ve been building for the web for years and years. We know it inside out. We build &amp;ldquo;web applications&amp;rdquo;. Think Facebook or where you do your online banking. It&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally different to building websites. Similar technology but usually involves 1000&amp;rsquo;s of hours, rather than 10&amp;rsquo;s or 100&amp;rsquo;s.
Why Web? You may have picked up on the &amp;ldquo;application&amp;rdquo; part of &amp;ldquo;web application&amp;rdquo;. You may wonder how that relates to the sort of application you have on your computer like Word or Excel.</description></item><item><title>Floc</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/floc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:11:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/floc/</guid><description>Background Sports coaching and children’s activities are big business, but most coaches loathe doing admin and chasing payments. It takes hours each week to administer courses and manage fees, yet coaching academies lose substantial income to missed payments, or risk driving away customers when they ask for larger block payments.
The Challenge From 25 years running coaching academies, Stuart Twigg was well aware of the problems of running an efficient, profitable coaching business.</description></item><item><title>Bullhorn</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/bullhorn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:11:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/bullhorn/</guid><description>Bullhorn are the world&amp;rsquo;s largest and most successful Recruitment CRM/ATS (Customer Relationship Management/Applicant Tracking System) so it&amp;rsquo;s no wonder we wanted to work with the best!
We&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Bullhorn for around 7 years, supporting both their and their customer&amp;rsquo;s growth. We offer customisation, configuration and integrationg third party services. Building portals, mobile apps or enhancing the core Bullhorn product.

Right from the outset, their approach was to change the way law was done. They work on behalf of insurance companies to offer pro-active support to their clients who have taken out a business risk policy. The idea being prevention is always better than a cure. As well as world class telephone and email support for their valued clients, RRadar wanted to add to their already successful &amp;ldquo;station&amp;rdquo; tool, which is a powerful knowledge base.</description></item><item><title>Saeker</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/saeker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:11:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/saeker/</guid><description>Background Saeker are health and safety consultants whose clients include major hotel groups and restaurant brands. Around ten years ago Saeker developed a system in-house which allowed them to create custom health and safety solutions for clients, to keep on top of all the risk assessments, checks, maintenance and record-keeping.
The Challenge Although the system was popular with customers it required substantial time and effort by Saeker’s staff to setup and administer.</description></item><item><title>Originem</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/originem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:11:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/originem/</guid><description>Originem are our ideal type of client - they knew their market and the solution needed, they had &amp;ldquo;made do&amp;rdquo; with off-the-shelf software to prove the market and wanted to build a best in class Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering. The software was to be able to run an Umbrella business - a business that pays temporary workers on behalf of the Recruitment agency that found them work.
Originem operated an Umbrella on behalf of their clients through their &amp;ldquo;Cubed&amp;rdquo; offering.</description></item><item><title>Yusen</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/yusen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/yusen/</guid><description>Yusen Logistics, although not a well known brand outside of their market, are one of the largest logistics firms in the world. They are vital to the supply chains of a host of brands you would use every day.
Most of the Logistics world are focussed on legact technology like IBM iSeries. They had a growing number of requirements to interface with a supplier&amp;rsquo;s and client&amp;rsquo;s systems in more modern ways that were inefficient using the technology they were experienced in.</description></item><item><title>Nlms</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/nlms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:10:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/previous-work/nlms/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 19:57:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/about/</guid><description>Make IT Simple are a motley band of brothers (and sisters). We work together because we like each other and because quite frankly, no one else would have us. A band of misfits.
Why do we do it? Because we love the game. We love creating. Every last one of us would be doing this even if we had to do something else for work. Building technology from scratch for a wide range of clients is hard.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 19:30:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andyjones789.github.io/mits-website-prototype/posts/first-post/</guid><description>This is my first post</description></item></channel></rss>
